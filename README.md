Voice-Enabled Chatbot with PyQt5 and OpenAI  

-This project integrates the OpenAI GPT model with a PyQt5 GUI application to build a chatbot capable of understanding both text and voice input.  

Features:  


-GUI Application: Utilizes the powerful PyQt5 library to create a user-friendly interface.    


-Text Chat: Users can type their questions and get responses instantly.  


-Voice Recognition: With the integration of the speech_recognition library, users can also speak their queries.  


-Integration with OpenAI GPT: Harnesses the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT model to generate human-like responses to user queries.  


Setup:  


Prerequisites: Ensure you have PyQt5, speech_recognition, and openai libraries installed.  

How it Works:  


-GUI Creation: The application starts by initializing a QMainWindow which contains various widgets like buttons, labels, and text input fields.  


-Event Handling: Button click events are connected to specific functions that process user input or start voice recognition.  


-Voice Recognition: The recognize_speech function captures audio from the microphone and converts it into text using Google's speech recognition service.  


-Generating Responses: The generate_chat_response function sends the user's query to the OpenAI API and fetches a response, which is then displayed on the GUI.  


Future Enhancements:  


-Multi-language support.  


-Improved error handling for voice recognition.  


-GUI beautification using Qt Designer or other styling methods.  


-Integration of advanced NLP techniques for better understanding and processing of user queries.

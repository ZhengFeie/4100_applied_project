#Exercise 7: Speech Recognition
#Learn how to use the speech_recognition library to capture speech from a microphone and convert it to text.

def recognize_speech(self):
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Please speak.....")
        audio = self.r.listen(source)
    return self.r.recognize_google(audio, language='en-US')

Detail Explanation:
In this exercise, students will learn how to use the speech_recognition library to capture spoken words from a microphone and convert them into text. Here's an explanation of the code:

1. Using a Microphone as a Source:

A statement is used to create a context for using the microphone as a source.
The source variable captures the audio from the microphone.

2. Capturing Audio:

A message "Please speak..." is printed to prompt the user to start speaking.
The listen method from the r object captures the audio input from the microphone and stores it in the audio variable.

3. Converting Speech to Text:

The captured audio is passed to the recognize_google method with the desired language parameter ('en-US' for English).
The method returns the recognized speech as text.
By implementing this code, students will enable their chatbot to capture voice input and convert it into text that can be processed and responded to by the application.

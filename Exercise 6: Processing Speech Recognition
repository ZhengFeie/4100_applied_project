# Exercise 6: Processing Speech Recognition
# Learn how to use the Speech Recognition Library to convert a user's voice input into text.

def start_speech_recognition(self):
    try:
        # speech recognition
        text = self.recognize_speech()

        # Display the recognition result in the input box
        self.input_text.setText(text)

    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        self.response_label.setText("Speech recognition could not understand audio")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        self.response_label.setText(f"Could not request results from speech recognition service; {e}")

Detail Explanation:
In this exercise, students will learn how to integrate speech recognition capabilities into their application using the Speech Recognition library. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.Speech Recognition:

The recognize_speech method is called to perform speech recognition using the user's microphone input.
The recognized speech is converted into text.

2.Displaying Recognition Result:

The recognized text is set as the content of the input box (self.input_text).

3.Handling Exceptions:

If the speech recognition engine cannot understand the audio (sr.UnknownValueError), an appropriate error message is displayed.
If there's an issue with requesting results from the speech recognition service (sr.RequestError), an error message related to the issue is shown.
By implementing this code, students will enable their chatbot to accept voice input, convert it into text, and process it as if the user had typed the text.

#Exercise 8: Generating Chat Responses
# Learn how to use OpenAI's API to generate chat responses based on user input.

def generate_chat_response(self, message):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine='text-davinci-003',
        prompt=message,
        max_tokens=2000,
        n=1,
        stop=None
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

Detail Explanation:
In this exercise, students will understand how to utilize OpenAI's API to generate chat responses based on user input. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.Generating Chat Responses:

The generate_chat_response method takes the user's message as an argument.
It uses OpenAI's Completion class to create a response based on the provided prompt (user message).
The parameters include the GPT model's engine, the user's message as the prompt, a maximum number of tokens (words), and n set to 1 to retrieve a single response.
The stop parameter specifies when the response should stop generating, and None means it will continue until reaching the maximum token limit.

2.Returning the Response:

The generated response text is extracted from the response object's choices and stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace.
By implementing this code, students will be able to generate responses from the GPT model based on user input, providing dynamic interactions between the user and the chatbot.

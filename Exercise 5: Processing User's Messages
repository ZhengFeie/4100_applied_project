#Exercise 5: Processing User's Messages
#Learn how to process a user's message and generate the appropriate response

def send_message(self):
    try:
        # Getting user input
        user_input = self.input_text.text()

        # Send a request to get a response
        response = self.generate_chat_response(user_input)

        # Displaying user input and responses on the Response tab control
        self.response_label.setText(f"user input: {user_input}\n response: {response}")

Detail Explanation:
In this exercise, students will grasp the process of sending user messages and generating suitable responses using OpenAI's GPT models. Here's an explanation of the code:

1.Getting User Input:

The user_input variable is assigned the text entered by the user in the input box.

2.Sending a Request to Get a Response:

The generate_chat_response method is called with the user_input as an argument to generate a response.

3.Displaying User Input and Response:

The response_label control is updated with a formatted string that includes the user input and the generated response.
If any errors occur during the process, an exception is caught and an error message is displayed.
By implementing this code, students will be able to interact with the chatbot by entering messages and receiving appropriate responses from the GPT model.
